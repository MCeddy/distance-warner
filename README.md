It is recommended to keep a distance of 1.5 meters.

If the car is too close the LEDs start to flash.

* VS code with platform.io extension
* one Arduino Nano or Uno
* one HC-SR04
* a few WS2812 compatible LEDs
* optional (!) a HC-05 bluetooth module (for sending distance values to your smartphone)
